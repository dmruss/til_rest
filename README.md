# til_rest (Today I Learned...) REST API

til_rest is a tool to help you remember random facts.  I know that when I am working on a project 
I will come across pieces of information that fit more under 'general knowledge' than the specific project I am working on.
Pieces of minutia that could save minutes or hours the next time that I need to remember it.
That is where this tool is useful: when you come across one of these facts, simply add it to the list and come check it out later.
Your fact will be recorded along with the date and time it was recorded, and any tags that you want to add to it.
When you want to recall the fact, simply search using a list of keywords and til_rest will return a list of possible matching facts.

## What's included?

til_rest is built as a serverless cloud application running in AWS.  This repo includes code to set up all the necessary infrastructure and permissions to get up and running.  The flow is the common api gateway -> lambda -> dynamodb paradigm.
The endpoint is secured using an api key.
